## About the Project
This repository is an english project exploring the literary and artistic possibilites of code as a textual and performative mode. The python3 code is intentionally obfuscated and is thoroughly unoptimized. The webpage is accessable at https://evangarber.github.io/doubt (if you visited the site before the final repo update, please clear your cache [ctrl-shift-r or cmd-option-r]). The syntax highlighting html was automated using an edited version of prism.js, with the original version available at https://prismjs.com. 
## How to View
The project is best experienced through downloading and running the python scripts in a terminal. Note that you may have to restart the terminal instance if you prematurely terminate a program. If you're uncomfortable running the scripts or would rather not bother, the webpage (linked above) attemts to simulate running the code in a terminal (however there are some sections that don't have the same feel). Overall, the project is a little more personal when you run the scripts and a little more detached when you visit the webpage.
