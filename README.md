# doubt
This repository is an english project exploring the literary and artistic possibilites of code as a textual and performative mode. The python3 code is intentionally obfuscated and is thoroughly unoptimized. The webpage is accessable at https://evangarber.github.io/doubt (if you visited the site before the final repo update, please clear your cache [ctrl-shift-r or cmd-option-r]). The syntax highlighting html was automated using an edited version of prism.js, with the original version available at https://prismjs.com.
